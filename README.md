# reauthor

In this project, I aim to use deeplearning4j's Word2Vec implementation to learn vector representations of words from literature, sourced from Project Gutenberg. Then, I will swap out words in a piece of literature with words that have similar vector representations but are more commonly used by another author. Hopefully the sample will still make sense!
