# reauthor

In this project, I aim to use deeplearning4j's Word2Vec implementation to learn vector representations of words from literature, sourced from Project Gutenberg. Then, I will swap out words in a piece of literature with words that have similar vector representations but are more commonly used by another author. Hopefully the sample will still make sense!

### Replacement Method

The top 10 similar words were found for each word in the sample (including the word itself). I then calculated a probability weighting for each of them:

weight = similarity + freqratio / (1 + freqratio). 

Similarity here is thecosine similarity score between thesource word and a candidate replacement. Freqratio is the ratio of author word fraction to corpus word fraction. The reason for dividing by 1+freqratio is to provide a mapping of the ratio which has support on [0, infinity) to a probability space with support on [0, 1). 

Randomly choosing fromthe weightng was accomplished by adding a uniform random variable to each weight, and selecting the word with the highest resulting score. There are certainly better ways of doing this, but I haven't figured out a multinomial distribution in java yet! A big problem with this implementation is that if the weights are all near 0, then it's just randomly selecting without weights.

### Sample Text
First, this is an example where author frequencies *were not* used to alter the text. Instead, only word similarities were used to randomly replace words.

|From even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent. Sometimes it enters directly into the composition of the events, while sometimes it relates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places. The latter sort is splendidly exemplified by a case in the ancient city of Providence, where in the late forties Edgar Allan Poe used to sojourn often during his unsuccessful wooing of the gifted poetess, Mrs. Whitman. Poe generally stopped at the Mansion House in Benefit Street--the renamed Golden Ball Inn whose roof has sheltered Washington, Jefferson, and Lafayette--and his favorite walk led northward along the same street to Mrs. Whitman's home and the neighboring hillside churchyard of St. John's, whose hidden expanse of Eighteenth Century gravestones had for him a peculiar fascination. | From something the greatest of betray irony is disclosure absent.

|Now the irony is this. In this walk, so many times repeated, the world's greatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to pass a particular house on the eastern side of the street; a dingy, antiquated structure perched on the abruptly rising side hill, with a great unkempt yard dating from a time when the region was partly open country. It does not appear that he ever wrote or spoke of it, nor is there any evidence that he even noticed it. And yet that house, to the two persons in possession of certain information, equals or outranks in horror the wildest fantasy of the genius who so often passed it unknowingly, and stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is unutterably hideous. |Now the irony is this.

|The house was--and for that matter still is--of a kind to attract the attention of the curious. Originally a farm or semi-farm building, it followed the average New England colonial lines of the middle Eighteenth Century--the prosperous peaked-roof sort, with two stories and dormerless attic, and with the Georgian doorway and interior panelling dictated by the progress of taste at that time. It faced south, with one gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill, and the other exposed to the foundations toward the street. Its construction, over a century and a half ago, had followed the grading and straightening of the road in that especial vicinity; for Benefit Street--at first called Back Street--was laid out as a lane winding amongst the graveyards of the first settlers, and straightened only when the removal of the bodies to the North Burial Ground made it decently possible to cut through the old family plots. | The boat was--and that that matter still is--of that kind for attract the attention of the curious.

| At the start, the western wall had lain some twenty feet up a precipitous lawn from the roadway; but a widening of the street at about the time of the Revolution sheared off most of the intervening space, exposing the foundations so that a brick basement wall had to be made, giving the deep cellar a street frontage with door and one window above ground, close to the new line of public travel. When the sidewalk was laid out a century ago the last of the intervening space was removed; and Poe in his walks must have seen only a sheer ascent of dull gray brick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a height of ten feet by the antique shingled bulk of the house proper. |At the start, the western wall have lain an twenty heels up a precipitous loneliness from the roadway; for an widening of that street at about the time of the Revolution sheared off most of the intervening space, exposing the foundations so but that brick basement wall had to be made, giving the intricate public-house a street frontage with door and one outer above ground, close to the new line for public travel.

### Discussion
Early on I used a tokenizer without part of speech tagging, and the results were really bad. I think for any serious machine learning approach to text, it's necessary to include part of speech tagging. Word sense was not tackled here, but that'd probably help quite a bit. 

Also the dl4j package uses the skip-gram implementation of word2vec, which predicts context from words. It occurred to me later on that if I had used a CBOW implementation, I might have been able to just use the predict function model itself to predict a word choice given the surrounding context, and this might have helped avoiding the suggestion of un-useful words.

Finally, I think the size of the corpus is just too small for a meaningful vocabulary change, and the larger difference between the authors is the semantic structure. To really get a different author-feel from a text, you'd need to analyze sentence structure, and have a solid way of replicating the ideas of a sentence in a new structure. (i.e. Dickens to Hemmingway would require cutting out like... all of the adjectives, adverbs, and clauses).
